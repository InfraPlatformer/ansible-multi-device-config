# Python Reverse Engineering Lab

This lab focuses on reverse engineering Python applications, bytecode analysis, and understanding Python internals.

## 🐍 Topics Covered

1. **Bytecode Analysis**
   - Understanding Python bytecode
   - Using `dis` module
   - Decompiling `.pyc` files

2. **Obfuscation Techniques**
   - String obfuscation
   - Control flow obfuscation
   - Anti-debugging techniques

3. **Binary Analysis**
   - PyInstaller extraction
   - cx_Freeze analysis
   - Standalone executable analysis

4. **Dynamic Analysis**
   - Runtime manipulation
   - Memory analysis
   - API hooking

## 📁 Exercise Structure

- `beginner/` - Basic bytecode and disassembly
- `intermediate/` - Obfuscated code analysis
- `advanced/` - Malware analysis and anti-analysis
- `tools/` - Custom analysis scripts
- `samples/` - Practice samples (safe, educational)

## 🛠️ Required Tools

```bash
pip install uncompyle6 pyinstxtractor-ng dis3
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with `beginner/bytecode_analysis.py`
2. Progress through difficulty levels
3. Use `tools/` for custom analysis
4. Practice with `samples/` directory
